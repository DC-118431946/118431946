        The club came into existence at the time of the foundation of the GAA itself in 1884.

In those early years, Canovee competed in the senior and junior championships organised by the newly formed Cork County Board. Even though the club went out of existence briefly in the 1920s,it was reformed in 1932 and joined the Mid Cork Divisional Board (Bord Muscrai).
